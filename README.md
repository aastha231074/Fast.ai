## What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning ia a computer technique to extract and transform data - by using multiple layer of neural networks. Each of these layers takes its inputs from previous layers and progressively refines them.

In layman terms machine learning is like regular programming, a way to get computers to complete a specific task.

Arthur Samuel's basic idea was instead of telling the computer the exact steps required to solve a problem, show it examples of the problem to solve and let it figure out how to solve it itself.

Here is how he decribed his idea:
Suppose we arrange for some **automation means** of testing the effectiveness of any current **weight assignment** in terms of **actual performance** and provide a mechanism for altering the **weight assignment** so as to maximize the performance.
