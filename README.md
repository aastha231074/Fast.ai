## 🧠 What is Deep Learning?

**Deep Learning** is a computer technique used to extract and transform data using multiple layers of neural networks. Each layer takes its inputs from previous layers and progressively refines them.

### 📌 In Simple Terms:

- _Machine learning_ is like regular programming—a way to get computers to complete specific tasks.
- Instead of explicitly defining steps, **Arthur Samuel** proposed letting the computer learn from examples.

### 🏆 Arthur Samuel’s Idea:

> _Instead of telling the computer the exact steps required to solve a problem, show it examples and let it figure out the solution itself._

He described his idea as follows:

> **"Suppose we arrange for some automation means of testing the effectiveness of any current weight assignment in terms of actual performance and provide a mechanism for altering the weight assignment so as to maximize the performance."**
